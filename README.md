The code shows is Python implentation of the paper. the results presnted in this nootebook are just for HOG features of 48 dimensions.
To replicate the resuls for other parameters setting of HOG and improved HOG algorithms please read carefully the paper.

### Dataset

We have used HODA dataset. This dataset contains 80,000 samples, 60,000 examples for training and 20,000 examples for testing extracted from about 12000 registration forms of university entrance examination in 313 Iran,
